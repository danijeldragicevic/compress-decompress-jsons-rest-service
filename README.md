**Example 2:** POST http://localhost:8081/api/compress </br>
Setting of Content-Type is mandatory. In this case we have to set it to the "application/json" type. </br>
Request body:
```
[
  {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  {
    "firstName": "Judy",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  {
    "firstName": "James",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  }
]
```
Response: 200 OK. <br/>
Response body:
```
{
    "message": "Successfully processed"
}
```
As result, compressed file with the payload content will be created on the "src/main/resources/output" path. </br>

**Example 2:** POST http://localhost:8081/api/decompress </br>
Setting of Content-Type is mandatory. In this case we have to set it to the "application/zip" type. </br>
To place compressed file in the payload it is most convenient to use some REST client tool. </br>
